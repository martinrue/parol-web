# Parol

Parol is a speech robot for Esperanto.

## Background

Commercial TTS engines tend not to support minority languages, particularly constructed languages such as Esperanto. It turns out Esperanto shares lots of sounds with Polish. By transcribing Esperanto to Polish, we can make commercial TTS engines give us a good approximation for spoken Esperanto.

Parol is a simple web frontend to a transcription API that produces Esperanto speech, making the idea more widely available and eaiser to use within Esperantujo.
